      <p>
        You’ve probably heard all kinds of advice about sleep:<br/>
        <em>“Go to bed early and you’ll sleep better.”</em><br/>
        <em>“More sleep means more energy.”</em><br/>
        <em>“The older you get, the worse you sleep.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But how true are these claims?  
        This interactive project dives into real-world data to explore the complex relationship between 
        <strong>bedtime, sleep quality, sleep duration, and age</strong>. 
        With a series of visualisations, we uncover surprising — and sometimes myth-busting — insights 
        about what actually contributes to a restful night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who sleeps the earliest? Who sleeps the best?  
        And which age group is secretly winning at sleep?  
        <strong>Let’s find out.</strong>

        <h2>🌙 Same Time, Different Age: Who’s Going to Bed Now?</h2>
        <p>
          For the young and restless, nighttime is when life really begins. Scrolling endlessly, gaming like there’s no tomorrow, zoning out, overthinking—somehow they manage to do eight entirely useless yet deeply satisfying things before bed. They’re not tired—they just refuse to let the day end too soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then come the planners and professionals. Sleep becomes a ritual: a warm shower, a cup of tea, Wi-Fi off by 10. It's not laziness—it’s strategic. That 8am meeting isn’t going to cancel itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          And finally, the peaceful sleepers. Not too early, not too late—just... whenever it feels right. Lights off at ten? Maybe. Staring at the ceiling at 3am? Also possible. They don’t force sleep; they listen to their bodies. For them, a good night’s rest is the gentlest form of self-respect.

        <h2>😴 Does Sleeping Early = Sleeping Well?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s easy to assume that going to bed earlier guarantees better sleep—but the data tells a more nuanced story.
        </p> 

        <p>
          Sleep quality doesn’t seem to follow the clock alone. While some age groups do show higher sleep quality at certain times, the pattern isn’t as straightforward as “the earlier, the better.” The chart reveals some clear patterns—and a few surprises.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe sleep is a bit of a mystery, shaped by age, habits, and other unknown factors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p class="section-title">SLEEP QUALITY VARIES WITH AGE AND SLEEP START TIME</p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Different age groups report different sleep quality even when going to bed at the same time. Sleep quality may depend on more than just bedtime.
        </p>

        <p class="analysis-text">
          I compared the number of people who went to bed between 20:00 and 21:00 with their reported sleep quality, and found no clear correlation.
          Similarly, among those who slept between 23:00 and 24:00, sleep quality still showed no strong link to timing.
          <strong>These results suggest that sleep quality may depend on a variety of factors — not just age or bedtime.</strong>

          <h2>🏆 Not Always First, But Often the Best Rested</h2>
          <p>
            Sleep quality doesn’t swing wildly between age groups — but on average, 26–30-year-olds seem to have found a pretty good rhythm.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Maybe it’s the sweet spot in life: young enough to bounce back from a late night, old enough to have a bedtime. With fewer family duties and decent health, this group just might have cracked the sleep-life balance (for now).
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast, the 46–50 group reports the lowest average. It's no surprise — this phase often comes with more responsibilities, more interruptions, and less time to rest. Life gets louder, and sleep gets... shuffled.

          <h2>⏰ Who Sleeps the Longest?</h2>
          <p>
            Sleep duration doesn’t differ dramatically between groups — but once again, the 26–30-year-olds are quietly winning. On average, they’re clocking the most hours under the covers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe it’s a golden window: grown-up enough to avoid all-nighters, but not yet tangled in life’s louder responsibilities. More sleep, less stress — not a bad deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the other end, those around 36–40 get the least sleep. It’s that “sandwich” stage — climbing career ladders while juggling family life. Fewer hours, more alarms. The dream? Just five more minutes.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep is deeply personal, influenced by lifestyle, stress, habits, and individual needs — not just age or bedtime. 
          Our data challenges the myth that sleeping early always leads to better rest. From early birds to night owls, everyone’s sleep journey is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          By exploring patterns across age groups and sleep times, we’ve uncovered valuable insights — but also many unanswered questions.
          In the end, good sleep isn’t just about when you sleep. It’s about how you live.
