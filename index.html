        You’ve probably heard all kinds of advice about sleep:<br/>
        <em>“Go to bed early and you’ll sleep better.”</em><br/>
        <em>“More sleep means more energy.”</em><br/>
        <em>“The older you get, the worse you sleep.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But how true are these claims?  
        This interactive project dives into real-world data to explore the complex relationship between 
        <strong>bedtime, sleep quality, sleep duration, and age</strong>. 
        With a series of visualisations, we uncover surprising — and sometimes myth-busting — insights 
        about what actually contributes to a restful night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who sleeps the earliest? Who sleeps the best?  
        And which age group is secretly winning at sleep?  
        <strong>Let’s find out.</strong>

        <h2>🌙 Same Time, Different Age: Who’s Going to Bed Now?</h2>
        <p>
          For the young and restless, nighttime is when life really begins. Scrolling endlessly, gaming like there’s no tomorrow, zoning out, overthinking—somehow they manage to do eight entirely useless yet deeply satisfying things before bed. They’re not tired—they just refuse to let the day end too soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then come the planners and professionals. Sleep becomes a ritual: a warm shower, a cup of tea, Wi-Fi off by 10. It's not laziness—it’s strategic. That 8am meeting isn’t going to cancel itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          And finally, the peaceful sleepers. Not too early, not too late—just... whenever it feels right. Lights off at ten? Maybe. Staring at the ceiling at 3am? Also possible. They don’t force sleep; they listen to their bodies. For them, a good night’s rest is the gentlest form of self-respect.

          Different age means different responsibilities.

        <h2>😴 Does Sleeping Early = Sleeping Well?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s easy to assume that going to bed earlier guarantees better sleep—but the data tells a more nuanced story.
        </p> 

        <p>
          Sleep quality doesn’t seem to follow the clock alone. While some age groups do show higher sleep quality at certain times, the pattern isn’t as straightforward as “the earlier, the better.” The chart reveals some clear patterns—and a few surprises.
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe sleep is a bit of a mystery, shaped by age, habits, and other unknown factors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <p class="section-title">SLEEP QUALITY VARIES WITH AGE AND SLEEP START TIME</p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Different age groups report different sleep quality even when going to bed at the same time. Sleep quality may depend on more than just bedtime.
        </p>

          <h2>🏆 The Real Sleep Quality Champions</h2>
          <p>
            Zooming out, we can see that 26–30-year-olds consistently lead in sleep quality. 
            Maybe it’s their routines, their health, or just good sleep karma — whatever it is, they’ve nailed it.

          <p>
            Sleep duration follows a similar trend — the same 26–30 group also gets the most hours of sleep on average. 
            So they’re not just sleeping well, they’re sleeping more. Jealous yet?
